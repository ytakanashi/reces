20150618; version 1.141:
    Updated srell_ucfdata.hpp to support Unicode 8.0.0.

20150517; version 1.140:
  * Modified the method for regex_match() to determine whether the
    regular expression is matched against the string.
    (Issue raised at #2273 in C++ Standard Library Issues List.)
  * Restricted the accepted range of X in the expression \cX to
    [A-Za-z] in accordance with the ECMAScript specification.
  * Fixed the problem that parens in look-around assertions did not
    capture strings correctly under some circumstances because the bug
    fix done in version 1.111 was imperfect.

20150503; version 1.130:
  * Improved case-folding functions.
  * Updated unicode/ucfdataout.cpp to version 1.100.
  * Fixed a typo in #if directives for u(16|32)[cs]match.

20150425; version 1.120:
  * Fixed the bug that characters ranged at U+010000-U+10FFFF in UTF-8
    (i.e., four octet length characters) were not recognised.
  * Updated misc/sample01.cpp to version 1.010.

20150402; version 1.111:
  * Fixed the problem that $2 of /aaa/ =~ /((.*)*)/ is empty instead of
    "aaa" because of a bug in optimisation.

20141101; version 1.110:
  * Several fixes based on a bug report:
      1. Added "this->" to compile() in basic_regex::assign().
      2. Implemented operator=() functions explicitly instead of using
         default ones generated automatically.
  * unicode/ucfdataout.cpp revised and updated to version 1.001.

20140622; version 1.101:
